string builder for string to be modified
strings are immutable in java
data is in stack or in heap.
string str ="h"
this will create a string "h" in heap
and a memory space in stack as str.
and as we change str a new str is created and the old one will be deleted.
as the str changes it takes higher time and as load increases the space time complexity increases too.
where as string builder doesn't do that it creates a mutable string.

any changes in string builder does not change the whole new string.
it just changes the current string builder
