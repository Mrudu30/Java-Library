array is a list of items of the same type in java.

Defining an array:
type[] arrayname = new type[size]
eg. int[] marks = new int[5]
can also be int marks[] = new int[5]
If you don't know what the size is going to be and define array in one go then :
int marks[] = {12,23,45} would also work

Array Indexing:
starts from 0
zero indexed arrays

what happens in memory:
4 bytes for each integer hence 12 bytes store 4 bytes

if nothing is defined it takes a bydefault number so it stores 0 for integer
